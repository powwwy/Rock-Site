This site was made as a school project. The first page contains a small tidbit about rocks (it's really just random stuff) 
The second page contains a list of the types of rocks and some of my favorite. 
The third page contains a table of rocks and some pictures of the ones i listed in page 2. The images will glow green when hovered in light mode but purple in dark mode.
The fourth page is the profile you will have to put in some login information to see how it works but this is where you can access dark mode and even edit the account. Find out how old you are with the age calculator!

So have fun experimenting and learn new things!! *THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES*
